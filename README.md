### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building high fault tolerance deployment systems for deploying ML/DL models on Kubernetes
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning Deep Learning (its been a while since I wrote a DNN)
- 🤔 I’m looking to help with pretty much anything!
- 💬 Ask me about Machine Learning, Kubernetes, CI, Scalability, etc. 
- 📫 How to reach me: arjun921@gmail.com or https://arjunsunil.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I might be a SDE by profession, but I'm also passionate about Flying Machines 🛩️ , Space travel 🛰, Scuba diving 🤿 and Cooking 🥞 or Baking 🥐
